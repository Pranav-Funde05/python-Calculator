# 🧮 Python Calculator

Welcome to my terminal-based calculator built using Python!  
This is one of my first Python mini-projects, and it supports basic arithmetic as well as square root and cube root calculations.

## 🔧 Features:
- ➕ Add
- ➖ Subtract
- ✖️ Multiply
- ➗ Divide
- √ Square Root
- ∛ Cube Root

## 📦 How to Use:
1. Run `calculator.py` in any Python environment (like VS Code or terminal)

3. Follow on-screen prompts

## 🚀 Made By:
**Pranav Funde** — 11th-grade coder from Maharashtra, passionate about Python and tech 🤖

## 📌 Future Plans:
- Add error handling (e.g. divide by 0)
- GUI version with Tkinter
- Maybe even a web version using Flask or Streamlit!
